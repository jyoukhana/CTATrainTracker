# CTATrainTracker
This is a repository for the CTA Train Tracker project, originally developed in May 2018 for my Raspberry Pi Lab class. This was developed between me and a partner in class.

CTA Train Tracker is a Python program that runs on a Raspberry Pi with additional hardware buttons/switches. This specific project utilized a toggle button and a rotary encoder knob for users to choose their CTA station, CTA line, and direction of travel.

This project utilized CTA's official train arrival time API in it's beta stage. Python's tkinter GUI was used as a main way of displaying information to the user.
